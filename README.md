# MLops Mini projects

## This repo is for the trial and understanding MLops by mini projects.
### This repo consists with three stages below

### Stage 01 
You can make your own MLops webapp with MNIST.
Actually you didn't use MNIST dataset, you make it with Streamlit Canvas.
You would write your own number(data) and do practice with them.

### Stage 02
You could try anomaly detection and apply MLops.
In this stage, data collection and validation steps are except.
I will give you some dataset related with vibration data as a log data.
You could change your models, hyperparameters, activation functions, and threshold.
If you have more interesting and time, you could try your own skills by fixing my code.

### Stage 03 
In this stage, you could do image detection and recognition with Yolo.
With this, I predict we could make our own face check service in our organization,
find something and tracking their location(actually it could also make models performance higher).

At this moment, I do my job on Stage 02.

If you have any qeustions on this repo,
