# TITLE : MLops_mini
### From Now(As-Is)
This repo is for showing Mlops structure in mini size to others who have interests in MLops.
At firtst commit, I made simple toolkit to show the performances of several models.
In this step, you could upload your model and test it by anomaly dataset and save the performance.



### To Future(To-Be)
After first step, I would add training steps and optimizting steps more.
In there, you could train your model as .tflite and manage your ML pipeline easily.

Actually it isn't perfect MLops structure becuase there isn't any steps for cellecting data and serving.
But by this, you could do training, taking A/B test between several models in many dataset(means several environment, not only lab env),
and managing your total dataset and models without any code.

So I call this MLops_mini and it could be a body in any other MLops Projects.
